In this section I will give a few examples of how I work.  Please review my approach to:

* [Royalty Setting](/usecase/royalty_setting/) including private copying remuneration and value transfer calculations;

* [Mapping the Music Industry](/usecase/music_industry_mapping/) such as re-use of public sector information and big data sources.

* [Economic Impact Assessments](/usecase/impact/) including private copying remuneration and value transfer calculations;

* [Surveys](/usecase/musicians/) about cultural access and participation and about creating value and jobs in the music and film sector;

* [Experimental and Innovative Data Sources](/usecase/big_data/) such as re-use of public sector information and big data sources.
