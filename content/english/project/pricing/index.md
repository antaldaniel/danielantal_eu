At a very early stage of my career I specialized in regulated prices and acquired a second degree in Economic Regulation and Competition Policy.  As an advisor to the minister, I set up a regulatory framework with new regulation for Hungarian freight railways.  As a regulator or as a consultant to the authority I participated in price reviews.  As a consultant to regulated industries, I helped making legally allowed pricing decisions or helped to challenge regulatory decisions.

Strategic pricing decisions have a profound impact on the value of companies and regulatory targets, too.  As a CFA charterholder, and as a person trained in competition policy and regulation, I understand both aspects.

In the first decade of the 21st century I worked in newly liberalized industries, including telecommunications, banks, insurance, transport and energy.    Later I focused more and more services with intangible assets, including data pricing and royalty pricing where I consider myself one of the most accomplished professionals in Europe.
