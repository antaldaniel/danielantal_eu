The three income streams model is essentially a value chain based model that was [developed in the United States](https://www.worldcat.org/title/music-business-and-recording-industry-delivering-music-in-the-21st-century/oclc/969999538&referer=brief_results) and adopted by the European Commission’s Joint Research Center for European CCI policy purposes [pdf download](http://ftp.jrc.es/EURdoc/JRC69816.pdf). We made minor adaptations in the three income model for applicability in Central Europe. 

While in the original American model sound recordings are the “main” income stream, currently, especially in Central Europe the live performance stream earns the most income for a typical musician. The author’s stream is the oldest, traditionally and analytically first part of the music industry that includes revenue streams based on musical works exploited by music publishers and via author’s CMO societies such as HDS. In the US it is called the publishing stream, but in Central Europe it is dominated by authors’ societies, so we modified the label.
